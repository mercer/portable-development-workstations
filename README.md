# Portable Development Workstations

## Why?

Because a developer shouldn't need hours to set up their development machines.

## Requirements
* I should be able to restore my dev environment withing 5 minutes
* I should have a similar ux with a containerized app as with the native app
* I should be able to access my files
* I should have a way to save settings and share them with my team mates



# todo
* have a desktop environment with vagrant
* provision steps
** system setup
** dotfiles
** apps

# fix
* login automatically
* remove duplication in Vagrantfile


# ideas
* make a vagrant box with stuff already installed


# advantages
* runs on any win/mac/linux
